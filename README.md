# Jade Browser

  Middleware for express/connect to expose jade templates to the web browser. It provides a few additional features like express-like render function with partial handling.
  
```javascript
var express = require('express')
  , jade_browser = require('jade-browser')
  , app = express.createServer();
  
app.use(jade_browser(url_endpoint, template_dir, options));
```

## Installation

    $ npm install jade-browser
  
## Features

  * Jade templates are served as compiled functions.
    * removes browser compatibility issues
    * increases speed of template execution
    * reduces file transfer size
  * ability to minify output
  * option to attach cache control
  * provides helpers for handling rendering/partials just like express.
  * relative path handling even from within partials.
  * ability to completely namespace to avoid any naming collisions on the browser.
  * partials inherit parent locals

## Usage

### In Node.js
  As middleware jade-browser is simple to use.

```javascript
var express = require('express')
  , jade_browser = require('jade-browser')
  , app = express.createServer();

app.use(jade_browser('/js/templates.js', __dirname + '/views', options));
```

#### Options
  - `namespace`   Namespace for the browser (default: 'jade')
  - `minify`    Minifies the output (default: false)
  - `maxAge`    Time in seconds to cache the results (default: 86400)
  
### Browser

```javascript
jade.render('path/to/template', { values: for_template });
```
    
For direct access (for templates that have no need for partials).

```javascript
jade.templates['path/to/template.jade'](locals);
```
    
Note: With render '.jade' extension is not required. Relative paths can be used in templates and in render function.

```javascript
jade.render('path/../to/../test');
```

  Large amounts of this code is inspired by TJ. Parts of express-expose and internal parts of express are recycled to make this happen.
